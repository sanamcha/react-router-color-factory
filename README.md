### Part 2: React Router Color Factory
The goal of this exercise will be to use React Router to build an app that lets you view colors and add new colors.

### User Stories
As a user, I can go to `/colors` to see a list of all available colors.

As a user, I can click on one of the colors in my colors list and get taken to a page where I can see that color in all its glory.

(The route here should be `/colors/:color` )

As a user, I can click on a button to show a form that will let me add a new color.

Note that you can give an input a type of color if youâ€™re trying to select a color. (The route here should be `/colors/new`)

As a user, when I submit my new color form, I am redirected to the colors index, and my new color appears at the top.

As a user, if I try to navigate to a color page that does not exist (eg, `/colors/blargh`), I am redirected to the colors index page.

As a user, if I try to navigate to an invalid url (eg, `/this-is-not-valid`), I am redirected to the colors index page.
